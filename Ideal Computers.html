            <p>Ideal Computers is a small tech shop where I did my Co-Op placement. It is located on 1315 Lawrence Ave E Unit #101 and I worked with two others in-person at this placement.  </p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/brokenPc.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>My main tasks here at this placement were to repair hardware, software, and resintall and update operating systems. Above was the picture of the worst pc I have dealt with. I remember I spent 4 days reinstalling and attempting to reprogram the windows operating system on this machine to no avail. It was tedious to say the least...</p>
            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">The Start</h2>
            <p>The first thing I noticed about my placement was my boss. I worked under Mr. Kim who was very personable right from the start. Our first interaction made me really motivated to help his company prosper, but I noticed quickly that there would need to be a whole redesign of the company's website.   </p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/image_8.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>This marked the start of my Co-Op journey! Ideal Computers needed a major change to help improve profitability and I was certain I could help them with this. I made it my personal mission to perfect their website, and the first job I took on was to help rebuild their website.  </p>
            <p>I knew I could make a positive change on the website, so I immediately started redesigning on that day. After a few days I proposed my demo website using the programming platform VSCODE to my coworkers and they agreed with the changes and plans I highlighted. However, I had to wait till Mr. Kim got back from his vacation to show him what I was working on.</p>
            <p>After the website demo was done, I was handling electronics and mainly repairing software and hardware. It does not seem very dangerous but there were hazards in the job. For example, if I handled the circuit board improperly there was a high chance I would get shocked. I also needed to make sure I was wiring correctly when taking computers apart, or else there was a chance they could blow up. It was also crucial that I didn't touch parts while they were powered on or else I could have gotten electrocuted, it was clear there were many objects I had to be careful around in the workplace.</p>
            <p>
              <img src = "images/buildingPC.webp" height = "50%" width = "100%" >
            </p>

            <p>With weeks working at the placement, I found there were some major challenges that Ideal Computers faced. For one, they had very little customers because of high competition with other companies doing similar services. This meant that on most days, I ended up having very little to do and not doing as much as I wanted to do in the workplace(this is important later). Secondly, I noticed that Ideal Computers was only targetting businesses and mainly seniors, causing a huge lack of representation with the younger generation. </p>
            <p>Knowing these two factors, each day felt very long as there were very little customers. Upon his return, us coworkers pitched our ideas to revamp the company to him and showed him our website demo. Unfortunately, there were some flaws and we did not end up finishing the website. Furthermore, the leadership and initiative I took to redesign the website personally was recognized by Mr. Young and I felt proud of taking responsibility to attempt to fix a problem.   </p>
            <p>I would not have been able to tackle the website project on my own, the leadership dynamics at Ideal Computers was Laissez Faire where each coworker was trying to better the company. Everyone at Ideal Computers were hardworking, and were some of the most likable people I have met in a professional setting, they always kept postive attitudes and showed me professionalism in my first working experience! Due to Ideal Computers I developed computer repair skills, practice rebuilding operating systems on machines, and also developed the skill of always improving previous iterations of designs. This experience has informed me that the IT field does not particularly interest me, and for the future I am more hesitant to go into a repetitive office job. After all the good experiences, I felt like I was finally at a standstill. My time could be better utilized elsewhere learning new skills I thought. Therefore, I chose to finish my time at Ideal Computers and explore other interests in different Co-Op opportunites. This led me to one of the most memorable video projects of my life, which I will discuss in my next blog :)</p>
