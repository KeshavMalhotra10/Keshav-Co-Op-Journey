            <p>Throughout the semester, I have faced numerous challenges that have strengthened me as a person. Co-Op has given a multitude of opportunties and leveraged my time to explore what I am most passionate about!</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/image_6.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>As you read, I worked in multiple placements. My first placement was as a technician at Ideal Computers, my second placement was with my school itself working as a videographer, and my last placement was at TKS where I was constantly learning to better understand Artificial Intelligence. Each of these placements allowed me to dive into a new career path that I could potentially explore in my future. </p>
            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">What I learned</h2>
            <!-- <p>After doing my research, I realized I could apply for my highschool's Co-Op program to be directly immersed in the fields I was thinking to be working in my future. This along with helping with my highschool SHSM requirements, Co-Op was a complete win-win scenario for me. I got to investigate into a question that had puzzled me for a long time, while also completing my obligations as a student.  </p> -->
            <p>
              <img src="images/image_8.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>The most important thing when working is to work on something you are passionate about or something of importance gaining you skills. This passion is sometimes hard to find as it takes a lot of trial and error, but what you can do is work on something important.  </p>
            <p>My semester started with a placement at Ideal Computers, I had some passion about learning to repair hardware but when I realized there were little clients, that passion got crushed too. This left me at a sinkhole as my work held no real importance. If it did hold importance such as my other placements where my work was held responsible for the success of others, or gave value to others, then I would have been much more disciplined at the placement. This is why I strongly believe to do your research to avoid my mistake before you try doing Co-Op. It is imperative to do your research before your Co-Op term to have a clear goal on where you want to do your placement. </p>
            <p>An example of importance in a placement could be my second placement with my school. The final video I would create as part of my placement would end up welcoming the next year of younger freshman at my school. This meant I had to put in the time and dedication to selectively highlight the achievements of my school. At TKS, I was putting my own reputation at stake by actively publishing research articles and algorithms for others to see. I was very passionate about the learning, and it held a great importance as it was me putting myself out there for the world to see and critique. This is why I excelled in both these placements! </p>
            <p>One of the most important learnings that is applicable to the whole year is to capitalize on the people you meet. It might sound confusing at first, but it is very powerful. Think about it like this, lets say you meet one new person every single day for one year and you keep them in your professional network. This would mean by the end of the year, you have officially met 365 new people that could help you in your life at some point. To capitalize on the people you meet, you want to always get to know those who work with you and always exchange contact information such as LinkedIn to advance your professional network. In all honesty, this comes in very handy in the long-run. After meeting founders and ceo's in my professional relations, I have been offered some internships and jobs by some connections. I feel like to be successful in general, you need to understand how to communicate and make professioanl relationships with others. This is especially crucial in the workplace where somebody you meet could easily help you achieve your goals! </p>
            <h2>My Overall Co-Op Rating</h2>
            <h3><strong>7/10</strong></h3>
            <br>
            <p>Out of my three Co-Op placements I would rank them TKS, Video Placement, and Ideal Computers. Co-Op really helped me enjoy this semester and learn a lot of what I would love to do in the future and what I definitely wanted to avoid. Trust me, after working hours everyday at each workplace it becomes second nature to understand what you are good at. For me, I love creating. If I was building something during Co-Op, I was happy. If I was doing some irrelevant repetitive task, then I felt my efforts were useless and my time was being wasted. The beginning of the semester I felt very bored as I ended up in the wrong placement for me, but the other two placements held some of my most cherished moments at school. The placements along with the freedom I had while doing Co-Op incline me to give it a 7/10 rating. It made my life interesting every single day and allowed me to lighten up my schedule as well. A win-win as a student!</p>
